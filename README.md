#Types an Programming Languages by Benjamin Pierce in Haskell

This is my work implementing the exercises to Pierce's text book, as I work
through them. The orginal text is implemented in OCaml. These can serve as an
example of how to develop programming languages and potentially how the Haskell
libraries work. It might make a nice reading supliment to anyone reading
through the text who is more familiar with Haskell than OCaml. Furthermore I
intend to use it as a springboard for further work of my own which might use 
some of these little languages as a starting point.

[07-untyped](07-untyped/README.md)

Others will be added as they are implemented.
