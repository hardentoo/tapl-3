#TaPL

Types and Programming Languages is a textbook by Benjamin Pierce. This is my
work implementing the exercises to Pierce's text book in Haskell.

New additions will be added as I work through them. The orginal implementations
for the excercies are in OCaml. They can be found here:
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/index.html

These repository can serve as an example of how to develop programming
languages and potentially how the related Haskell libraries work. I will be
adding my own notes and commentary as I go through the text, which will
hopefully provide some additional insight. It might make a nice reading
supliment to anyone reading through the text who is more familiar with Haskell
than OCaml. Furthermore I intend to use it as a springboard for further work of
my own which might use some of these little languages as a starting point.
